# fourth-sector
Many of us involved by looping of life cycle. Birth, raise, study, study more, work, married, make a baby, work more and more. What we are pursuing for? Money?
I hope we can raise our humanity in the future by breaking the loop. We have to realize that we have advantages over other creations on the world: intellectuality.
We have created technology to ease our life. Yes, we have created. But, our ambition about money blind us. Technology does not ease our life anymore, but ease my life, not your life.
I have a vision to break the economic sector in the world. We work not to make money, but we work to find a new thing to enhance our civilization. By what? By our intellectuality.
>>So, if we work not to make money, where we can get the livelihood? That is the wrong perception about wealth.
With technology, we able to shift our role about work. Machine do our work, not us.
>>So, machine will reduce someone's job?
Yes, so he can shift his job from pursuing money into developing civilization.
Maximize our potential. "Give human job that machine cannot do"
